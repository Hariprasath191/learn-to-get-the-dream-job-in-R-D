# ✅ WEEK 5 — Core Statistics & Probability Checklist

## 🎯 Goal
Build strong **statistics and probability concepts** — essential for Data Science & ML. Learn how to describe data, detect patterns, measure relationships, and understand uncertainty.

---

## 📌 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

- [ ] Mean, Median, Mode — when to use which
- [ ] Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- [ ] Quartiles, Percentiles, IQR
- [ ] Summary stats in Pandas: `.describe()`

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Write Python functions to calculate mean, median, mode manually.

---

## 📌 2️⃣ Data Distributions

- [ ] Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)
- [ ] Uniform Distribution
- [ ] Skewness: Positive vs Negative
- [ ] Kurtosis: Light vs Heavy tails

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Plot normal & uniform distributions with `np.random`.

---

## 📌 3️⃣ Visualization for Statistics

- [ ] Histogram: visualize distribution
- [ ] Boxplot: see outliers & spread
- [ ] Violinplot: mix of box & KDE

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Compare boxplot vs violinplot for same column.

---

## 📌 4️⃣ Correlation & Covariance

- [ ] Pearson Correlation Coefficient
- [ ] Covariance: what it means
- [ ] `.corr()` & `.cov()` in Pandas
- [ ] Correlation Heatmap with Seaborn

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Find correlation between Age & Fare in Titanic.

---

## 📌 5️⃣ Probability Basics

- [ ] What is Probability? P(E)
- [ ] Independent & Dependent Events
- [ ] Conditional Probability: P(A|B)
- [ ] Complementary Events

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Toss coin, roll dice examples with probabilities.

---

## 📌 6️⃣ Random Variables

- [ ] Discrete vs Continuous
- [ ] Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- [ ] Probability Density Function (PDF)

✔️ *Mini-Task:* PMF for dice roll, PDF for normal distribution.

---

## 📌 7️⃣ Combinations & Permutations

- [ ] Factorial basics
- [ ] Permutations: nPr
- [ ] Combinations: nCr
- [ ] `itertools.permutations` & `itertools.combinations`

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Calculate possible passwords with 3 letters.

---

## 📌 8️⃣ Bayes Theorem

- [ ] Concept & real examples
- [ ] Simple calculation: spam filter example

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Small notebook cell: P(A|B) with simple numbers.

---

## 📌 9️⃣ Sampling & Central Limit Theorem

- [ ] What is sampling?
- [ ] Population vs Sample
- [ ] Sampling Bias
- [ ] Central Limit Theorem: why sample means become normal

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Generate random samples, plot sample means.

---

## 📌 🔟 Hypothesis Testing Basics

- [ ] Null & Alternative Hypotheses
- [ ] Type I & II Errors
- [ ] p-value — what it tells you
- [ ] Confidence Intervals

✔️ *Mini-Task:* Example: is average height > 170cm?
